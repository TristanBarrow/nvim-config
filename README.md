This is a repository for my personal NeoVim Setup.

You will need to run the following command before attempting to install packages.

```zsh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim ~/.config/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Also the `setup.bash` file in the root folder will also run this command.

After running this once the process for updating things should be as normal.
